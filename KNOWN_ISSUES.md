# Known Issues

This document tracks known bugs and issues that need to be addressed in future updates.

## Composite Sprite Animator (CSA)

### High Priority

- **Animation "ends" behavior not honored**: The end behavior setting (loop, hold, clear) is no longer being respected during playback
- **Stop and Rewind do the same thing**: Both buttons currently rewind to frame 0; Stop should pause at current frame

### Low Priority / Needs Discussion

- **Frame counter label (F: 000/000)**: Question whether this label is necessary in the CSA playback controls

## Future Enhancements

_(Items to be added as needed)_
